Description:
    Perf C2C monitor is aimed for capturing hot cache line miss during the
    process of running workload, the total number of local/remote cache line
    HITM would be a very important performance metric to evaluate our
    optimzation work. Also, the top 3 cache lines ranked by HITM number
    should be given serious care as main optimization target.

    The first version of code refers to monitor/no-stdout/perf-profile.

Usage:
    linux/tools/perf/Documentation/perf-c2c.txt

Parameters:
    event: "[ldlat-loads|ldlat-stores] :: PMU event :: All as default"
    mode: "[u|k] :: Track use space or kernel space events :: All as
	    default"
    ldlat: "[30|50|*] :: Configure mem-load latency :: 30 as default"
    delay: "[15|20|*] :: Delay *N* seconds before sampling :: 100 as
	    default, or half of runtime if runtime is set"
    duration: "[10|20|*] :: Record sample within *N* seconds :: 10 as
	    default"
