## The following these btrfs relevant testcases will be filtered, since some cases still have a bug in latest version(such as btrfs/047),
## and the others are test function failure, to void generate the error info in 'lkp log', we also need to filter these testcases.
## In addition, "btrfs/101" need to the newer btrfs-tools packages,but our repo is a bit old, can't upgrade to the very new btrfs-tools version,
## so we also filter this sub item temporarily.
