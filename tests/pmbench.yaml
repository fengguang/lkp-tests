 pmbench - paging and virtual memory benchmark

description: |
 pmbench is a micro-benchmark that profiles system paging performance by
 measuring latencies of  each  memory  access  throughout  the  run  and
 reporting the statistics of measured latencies.

homepage: 

parameters:
 runtime: 
 mapsize: Specify virtual address map size in Mebibyte (2^20 bytes)  unit. The default is 256.
 setsize: Specify  working  set  size  in  Mebibyte unit.  It should be no greater than mapsize. The default is 128.
 pattern: (linear, uniform, normal, pareto)  
 shape: Pattern-specific  numeric parameter that determines the shape of the distribution.  See Usage for details.   
 jobs: Number of concurrent worker threads to spawn for the  benchmark. Some releases may not support this option. The default is 1.
 timestamp: (rdtsc, rdtscp, perfc)
 cold: (y, n)
 access: (histo, touch)
 delay: Delay between accesses in clock cycles
 initialize: (y, n) Initialize memory map with garbage data
 offset: Specify static page access offset (default random)
 quiet: (y, n) Don't produce any output until finish
 ratio: Percentage read/write ratio (0 = write only, 100 = read only; default 50)
 threshold: The threshold time to trigger the ftrace log, unit is ns.
