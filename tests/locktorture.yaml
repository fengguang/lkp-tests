 The CONFIG LOCK_TORTURE_TEST config option provides a kernel module that runs
 torture tests on core kernel locking primitives. The kernel module,
 'locktorture', may be built after the fact on the running kernel to be tested,
 if desired. The tests periodically output status messages via printk(), which
 can be examined via the dmesg (perhaps grepping for "torture").  The test is
 started when the module is loaded, and stops when the module is unloaded. This
 program is based on how RCU is tortured, via rcutorture.

 This torture test consists of creating a number of kernel threads which
 acquire the lock and hold it for specific amount of time, thus simulating
 different critical region behaviors. The amount of contention on the lock can
 be simulated by either enlarging this critical region hold time and/or
 creating more kthreads.
