 DBENCH is a tool to generate I/O workloads to either a filesystem or to a
 networked CIFS or NFS server. It can even talk to an iSCSI target. DBENCH can
 be used to stress a filesystem or a server to see which workload it becomes
 saturated and can also be used for preditcion analysis to determine "How many
 concurrent clients/applications performing this workload can my server handle
 before response starts to lag?"

 DBENCH provides a similar benchmarking and client emulation that is
 implemented in SMBTORTURE using the BENCH-NBENCH test for CIFS, but DBENCH can
 play these loadfiles onto a local filesystem instead of to a CIFS server.
 Using a different type of loadfiles DBENCH can also generate and measure
 latency for NFS.
