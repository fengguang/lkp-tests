description: 
    lmbench is a suite of simple, portable, ANSI/C microbenchmarks for
    UNIX/POSIX. In general, it measures two key features (latency and
    bandwidth). lmbench is intended to give system developers insight
    into basic costs of key operations. 
    - Bandwidth benchmarks
       1) Cached file read,
       2) Memory copy (bcopy),
       3) Memory read,
       4) Memory write,
       5) Pipe,
       6) TCP.
    - Latency benchmarks
       1) Context switching,
       2) Networking connection establishment, pipe, TCP, UDP, and RPC hot
       potato,
       3) File system creates and deletes,
       4) Process creation,
       5) Signal handling,
       6) System call overhead,
       7) Memory read latency.
    - Miscellanious
       1) Processor clock rate calculation

    nr_threads: "if you are running on an MP machanie and you want to try 
        running multiple copies of lmbench in parallel, you can specify
        how many here [default 1]"
    test_memory_size: "memory size used for this test, The bigger the
        range, the more accurate the results, but larger sizes take
        somewhat longer to run the benchmark. Suggest to use 50% of total 
        memory size"
