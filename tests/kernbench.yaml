short_description: >
Kernbench is a CPU throughput benchmark. It is designed to compare kernels on
the same machine, or to compare hardware.
It runs a kernel compile at various numbers of concurrent jobs: 1/2 number
of CPUs, optimal (default is 4xnumber of CPUs), and maximal job count.
Optionally it can also run single threaded. It then prints out a number of
useful statistics for the average of each group of runs.

This is a cpu throughput benchmark. It is designed to compare kernels on the
same machine, or to comparehardware.
To compare hardware you need to be running the same architecture
machines (eg i386), the same userspace binaries and run kernbench on the same
kernel source tree.
It runs a kernel at various numbers of concurrent jobs: 1/2 number of cpus,
optimal (default is 1xnumber of cpus) and maximal job count. Optionally it can
also run single threaded and a custom number of jobs. It then prints out a
number of useful statistics for the average of each group of runs and logs them
to kernbench.log
You need more than 4Gb of ram for this to be a true throughput benchmark with
the -M option or else you will get swapstorms.
Ideally it should be run in single user mode on a non-journalled filesystem,
from a ramdisk would be even better. To compare results it should always be
run in the same kernel tree.
