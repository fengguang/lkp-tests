 Pft is the page fault test micro benchmark.

description: |
 Pft is original from Christoph Lameter's "Page Fault Test" tool, and posted to
 LKML http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/29/294, modified by Lee Schermerhorn for mem
 policy testing.

 It is changed to allocate single large region before creating worker
 threads/tasks. Then, carve up the region, giving each worker a piece to fault
 in. This will cause the workers to contend for the cache line[s] holding the
 in-kernel memory policy structure, the zone locks and page lists, ... In
 multi-thread mode, the workers will also contend for the single test task's
 mmap semaphore.
