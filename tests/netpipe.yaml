 NetPIPE is a protocol independent performance tool that encapsulates
 the best of ttcp and netperf and visually represents the network
 performance under a variety of conditions.

 NetPIPE uses a simple series of ping-pong tests over a range of message sizes
 to provide a complete measure of the performance of a network. It bounces
 messages of increasing size between two processes, whether across a network or
 within an SMP system. Message sizes are chosen at regular intervals, and with
 slight perturbations, to provide a complete evaluation of the communication
 system. Each data point involves many ping-pong tests to provide an accurate
 timing. Latencies are calculated by dividing the round trip time in half for
 small messages ( less than 64 Bytes  ).

 The communication time for small messages is dominated by the overhead in the
 communication layers, meaning that the transmission is latency bound. For
 larger messages, the communication rate becomes bandwidth limited by some
 component in the communication subsystem (PCI bus, network card link, network
 switch).

 These measurements can be done at the message-passing layer (MPI, MPI-2, and
 PVM) or at the native communications layers that that run upon (TCP/IP, GM for
 Myrinet cards, InfiniBand, SHMEM for the Cray T3E systems, and LAPI for IBM SP
 systems). Recent work is being aimed at measuring some internal system
 properties such as the memcpy module that measures the internal memory copy
 rates, or a disk module under development that measures the performance to
 various I/O devices.
