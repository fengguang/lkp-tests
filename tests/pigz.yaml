 Pigz, which stands for parallel implementation of gzip, is a fully functional
 replacement for gzip that exploits multiple processors and multiple cores to
 the hilt when compressing data.

description: |
 Pigz compresses using threads to make use of multiple processors and cores.
 The input is broken up into 128 KB chunks with each compressed in parallel.
 The individual check value for each chunk is also calculated in parallel. The
 compressed data is written in order to the output, and a combined check value
 is calculated from the individual check values.

 The compressed data for mat generated is in the gzip, zlib, or single-entr y
 zip for mat using the deflate compression method. The compression produces
 partial raw deflate streams which are concatenated byasingle write thread and
 wrapped with the appropriate header and trailer, where the trailer contains
 the combined check value.

 Each partial raw deflate stream is terminated by an empty stored block (using
 the Z_SYNC_FLUSH option of zlib), in order to end that partial bit stream at a
 byte boundary. That allows the partial streams to be concatenated simply as
 sequences of bytes. This adds a ver y small four to five byte overhead to the
 output for each input chunk.

 The default input block size is 128K, but can be changed with the -b option.
 The number of compress threads is set by default to the number of online
 processors, which can be changed using the -p option. Specifying -p 1 avoids
 the use of threads entirely.

 The input blocks, while compressed independently, have the last 32K of the
 previous block loaded as a preset dictionary to preser ve the compression
 effectiveness of deflating in a single thread. This can be turned off using
 the -i or --independent option, so that the blocks can be decompressed
 independently for partial error recovery or for random access.

 Decompression can’t be parallelized, at least not without specially prepared
 deflate streams for that purpose. Asaresult, pigz uses a single thread (the
 main thread) for decompression, but will create three other threads for
 reading, writing, and check calculation, which can speed up decompression
 under some circumstances. Parallel decompression can be turned off by
 specifying one process ( -dp 1 or -tp 1  ). Compressed files can be restored
 to their original for m using pigz -d or unpigz.
