 The motivation behind this suite is to exercise functions and regions of the
 mm/ of the Linux kernel which are of interest to us. There are many more
 regions which have not been covered by the test cases.

 The test suite was developed with the help of gcov code coverage analysis
 tool. Gcov can be enabled as a configuration option in linux kernel 2.6 and
 upwards. GCOV gives a per line execution count for the source files. The
 supporting tool versions that were used in the development of the suite are

 - gcov   - 4.6.3
 - gcc    - 4.6.3
 - Kernel - 3.4

 The test kernel needs to be configured with the following options set

        CONFIG_LOCK_STAT=y

        CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL=y
        CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL=y

        CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS=y
        CONFIG_FTRACE_SYSCALLS=y

        CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE=y

 Once the test kernel has been compiled and installed, a debugfs is mounted on
 /sys/kernel.  writing to the file /sys/kernel/debug/gcov/reset resets all the
 counters. The directory /sys/kernel/debug/gcov/ also has a link to the build
 directory on the test system. For more information about setting up gcov,
 consult the gcov documentation.

 The cases in the suite call an exucutable file with options. Most of the cases
 work on usemem. Some of the cases that call other ececutables have been
 written in seperate files in order to modularise the code and have been named
 based on the kernel functionality they exercise.

 Some of the cases merely call trivial system calls and do not do anything
 else. They can be extended suitably as per need.

 Some cases like case-migration, case-mbind etc need a numa setup. This was
 achieved using the numa=fake=\<value\>. The value is the number of nodes to be
 emulated. The suite was tested with value = 2, which is the minimum value for
 inter-core page migration. passed as a kernel boot option. Those cases that
 require the numa setup need to be linked with -lnuma flag and the libnuma has
 to be installed in the system. The executables that these cases call have been
 taken from the numactl documentation and slightly modified. They have been
 found to work on a 2 node numa-emulated machine.

 cases which require the sysfs parameters to be using `echo <value> >
 sysfs_parameter` set may need tweaking based on the system configuration. The
 default values used in the case scripts may not scale well when systems
 parameters are scaled. For example, for systems with higher memory, the
 /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/pages_to_scan may be needed to
 be set to a higher value or the scan_sleep_millisecs needs to be reduced or
 both. Failure to scale the values may result in disproportional or sometimes,
 no observable coverage in corresponding functions.

 cases can be run individually using

 ./case-name

 with the suite directory as pwd. The scripts work under this assumption. Also,
 care has to taken to make sure that the sparse root is mounted. The run_cases
 script takes care of mounting the sparse partition before running the scripts.

 Hugepages are assumed to be of 2MB.
