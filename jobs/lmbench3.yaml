  - SYSCALL
  - FILE
  - CTX
  - BCOPY
# From Lmbench3 source scripts, run lat_connect when "$SYNC_MAX = 1", so case CONNECT only test with 1 thread.
  - CONNECT
# Case UDP can get test result when nr_threads=1, if nr_threads set as 50%,100%, can't get correct result, showing "Recv timed out".
  - UDP
# MEM is about cache and memory latency related case, it will take more than 2 hours on test machine lkp-bdw-ep4.
